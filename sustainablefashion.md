### The Big Picture
I have a heavy interest in the fashion industry - specifically, circular fashion and the importance of being mindful with how we obtain and value our garments to make them last. A big part of the circular fashion equation is textile recycling. On an individual scale, people can take clothes to Goodwill... but what happens if nobody wants your clothes? Short answer: they end up in a landfill. At this point, the problem becomes an industry issue. The question I started with for this assignment was this: we have the brains for industrial-level textile recycling, so why aren't we doing it?

When thinking of telling a story around this concept, I considered three reader groups: fashion executives, average citizens, and engineers/scientists capable of designing processes for large scale textile recycling. From these reader groups, I saw the user stories below:

As a _fashion executive_, I want _explanations_ so that I can _understand textile recycling supply chains._ 

As an _average citizen_, I want _to know ways I can participate in circular fashion_ so I can _make an individual impact on climate change_. 

As a(n) _scientist/engineer_, I want _to understand industry barriers_ so I can _innovate new technologies for change_. 

Then, I framed the story I wanted to tell using the story arc below:

For now, I think I'll need two data visualizations to drive home my point, but I may end up combining them at some point for the final submission.
