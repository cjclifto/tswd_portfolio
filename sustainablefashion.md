### The Big Picture
I have a heavy interest in the fashion industry - specifically, circular fashion and the importance of being mindful with how we obtain and value our garments to make them last. A big part of the circular fashion equation is textile recycling. On an individual scale, people can take clothes to Goodwill... but what happens if nobody wants your clothes? Short answer: they end up in a landfill. At this point, the problem becomes an industry issue. The question I started with for this assignment was this: we have the brains for industrial-level textile recycling, so why aren't we doing it?

When thinking of telling a story around this concept, I considered three reader groups: fashion executives, average citizens, and engineers/scientists capable of designing processes for large scale textile recycling. From these reader groups, I saw the user stories below:

As a _fashion executive_, I want _explanations_ so that I can _understand textile recycling supply chains._ 

As an _average citizen_, I want _to know ways I can participate in circular fashion_ so I can _make an individual impact on climate change_. 

As a(n) _scientist/engineer_, I want _to understand industry barriers_ so I can _innovate new technologies for change_. 

Then, I framed the story I wanted to tell using the story arc below:

For now, I think I'll need two data visualizations to drive home my point, but I may end up adding a third visualization somewhere by the time it's all said and done. 

### Initial Sketches
To tell my story, I want to point out the shocking impact that our clothes have on climate change. To do this, I plan to use some data about top industries that contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, of which the fashion industry is a large part, highlighting the "point of no return" value outlined by climate scientists around the world - and more importantly, how close we are to that line in recent years!

However, I don't want the whole story to be doom and gloom. I want to have a clear message at the end of my story that industrial-level change may seem too much of a behemoth to take on, but it's totally possible! I plan to write about key metrics that indicate this change is possible (e.g., the Eureka Innovation Lab at Levi's, whose designers engineered a way to laser-distress denim jeans, reducing water consumption used to make a single pair of jeans by 96 percent). I don't have much raw data to work with for this point besides a bunch of callout statistics, so I thought a good way to visualize this would be a timeline. Along this timeline, key indicators of hope for a more sustainable fashion industry will be pointed out, leading to the open-ended land of opportunity in the "future of fashion."

### Let's Examine the Data
My first main data set is from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The EPA compiles data into [an annual report](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/inventory-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-and-sinks) for greenhouse gas emissions and sinks, or places where carbon emissions are eaten up (e.g., large forested areas), across the United States. They provide a [data explorer](https://cfpub.epa.gov/ghgdata/inventoryexplorer/#industry/entiresector/allgas/category/all) that allows for interaction and downloading of the raw data used in the summary report. The data goes back to 1990, and I plan to show the increase of emissions across this entire span.
