## Visualizing Student Debt in the United States
Telling Stories with Data
Assignment 3 & 4: Critique by Design
Author: Clarissa Clifton

### Original data visualization background
The visualization I chose to critique and redesign is about student debt in the United States. [The Forbes article in which I found the data](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/student-loans/average-student-loan-debt-statistics/)
appears to simply point out how much the cost of college-level education has increased, rather than pointing out any trends or making any analysis. It reads as a fact list with raw data included.

### Critique
First, let's take a look at an example data table in the Forbes article: <img width="742" alt="forbes_table" src="https://github.com/cjclifto/tswd_portfolio/assets/140766598/c1aa7f76-e6de-4be9-9a80-bd8da6b54f2b">
