## Who is Clarissa?
My name is Clarissa (she/her). I am a Dual MS student at Carnegie Mellon studying Biomedical Engineering and Engineering & Technology Innovation Management. I am passionate about designing diagnostics devices, particularly for applications in rural areas or areas of the world without easy access to medical clinics. Outside of my career path, I love doing art - I always have my hands in some sort of creative project! 

## What I hope to learn from Telling Stories with Data
I already have a serious interest in data visualization prior to this class. Data viz scratches the itch in my brain where my engineering and arty sides meet. During this semester, I'm hoping to gain some formal techniques for data visualizaton and proper frameworks for making good design decisions. I have an adjacent love for technical writing, which I feel is closely related to data visualization. In technical writing, the key is to communicate technical information at a high acuity to the layperson. To me, data visualization accomplishes a very similar task! Any information I have is useless if I can't effectively communicate it my audience. I'm hoping to learn best practices for this effective communication!

Once I graduate, I plan to work in the startup world on disease diagnostics platforms. I'm extremely passionate about this field, and I love startup environments for the interdisciplinary nature of their work, mass amounts of opportunity to creatively problem solve, and the challenge of bringing a new technology to the communities it can have the most positive impact on.

### Visualizing Government Debt
The visualization below is from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) from the [General Government Debt page](https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-debt.htm). This visualization shows data from 2017, with the lowest and highest debt-to-GDP ratios highlighted (Estonia and Japan, respectively). The United States is also highlighted to give an easy context clue for American audiences.

The following visualization shows many countries' debt-to-GDP ratios from 1995-2021. Many countries have experienced a consistent rise in government debt since the mid-1990s, with a spike during 2020 - or, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, all countries besides Latvia, Brazil, and New Zealand show a decrease from this spike post-pandemic.
